# Analyze Air Pollution Levels (Data-Analyst-Dashboard-project-1)
## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to design a Power BI dashboard that enables users to monitor and analyze air pollution levels across various regions. The report focuses on tracking key air quality indicators over time and identifying patterns, hotspots, and areas that require environmental attention or policy intervention.
## Dataset Used 
- <a href= "https://github.com/Comhek0369/Data-Analyst-Dashboard-project-1/blob/main/dashboard%20project%201.png">Dataset</a>
## Questions / KPIs Addressed
This report answers key environmental and policy questions such as:
1.	What is the average AQI across regions over the selected period?
2.	Which cities/regions have the highest levels of PM2.5 and PM10?
3.	How does air quality vary by month/season/year?
4.	Are there correlations between temperature, humidity, and pollution levels?
5.	How often does air quality breach safe thresholds (e.g., WHO limits)?
KPIs Tracked:
•	Average AQI
•	Max/Min PM2.5 and PM10
•	Days with "Unhealthy" AQI levels
•	Pollution trends over time
## Process
1.	Data Collection
o	Imported data from [insert source: CSV/API/database]
2.	Data Cleaning & Transformation
o	Removed nulls, standardized date formats
o	Created calculated columns for AQI categories
3.	Data Modeling
o	Built date and geography dimensions
o	Set up relationships between pollutant measures and time/location
4.	Visualization in Power BI
o	Created bar charts, maps, line graphs, and KPIs
o	Added slicers for region and time filtering
## Project Insights
•	Cities with high traffic and industrial activity show consistently poor air quality.
•	PM2.5 levels tend to spike during colder months, likely due to heating and stagnant air.
•	A clear seasonal pattern emerges, with summer months typically showing lower pollutant concentrations.
•	Some cities breach WHO safe limits on more than 50% of observed days.
•	Correlation observed between high PM2.5 and temperature inversion periods.
## Final Conclusion
The Air Pollution Index Report successfully highlights critical pollution trends and hotspots using clean and interactive Power BI visualizations. This report can assist environmental agencies, researchers, and policy planners in identifying problem areas, allocating resources, and designing effective mitigation strategies.
With further enhancements like real-time data integration and predictive forecasting, this dashboard can evolve into a real-world decision support system for environmental governance.
